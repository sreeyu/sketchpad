This is a simple web application that generates a grid of squares using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The grid is initially set to a size of 16x16 squares, but the user can customize the size by clicking the "Change Grid!" button and entering a new number of squares in a popup window.

## Usage
To use the application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The grid of squares will be displayed on the page, and you can hover over each square to change its background color.

To change the size of the grid, click the "Change Grid!" button. A popup window will appear asking you to enter a new number of squares. After entering a value, click the "Okay" button to update the grid.

## Future Developments
* Add a range slider so the user can input the number of squares through it.
* Add colors so that the user can choose a color according to their needs.
